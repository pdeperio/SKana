Major strip-down of official_macro_root for simple cosmic ray analysis with fiTQun.

----------------------------------------------------------

- Detail of each file

* global.h and global.cc
   Summary of livetime, root file name, etc.
   (NOTE) If you increase the data range, global.cc is the only file you need to correct.

* Official.cc
   Control event loop.

* OfficialEventParser.cc
   is called by Official.cc for each event. 
   Apply cuts and fill histograms and save them to output root file.
   Modified from original to fill histograms with variables from both 
   APFIT (reco0) and fiTQun (reco1). 

* OfficialEventParser.h

   Additional hardcoded parameters: 
   
       particleIndices: fiTQun particle hypothesis indices for 1-ring results

* make_plots.cc
  just call DrawHistograms.cc

* DrawHistograms.cc
  Read histograms from a root file generated by OfficialEventParser.cc,
  draw on canvas and do cosmetic, then save it to PDF and PNG files.
  Modified to draw a set of canvases for specified reconstruction by 
  command line.

- How to run

  1) Prepare root files from hbk files

  2) Check global.cc if root files are properly linked.

  3) Run official_macro_root

  gmake official
  official 4 osc  1097 (sk4 and oscillation, livetime is 1097)   
 
  (Note that all arguments have no functionality at this point.)

  OR, you can commit these jobs to NQS.
  ./submit.sh 1 noosc

  ( Or, if you just want to check if it works, you can do
  official 1 noosc test
  This loops over small amount of MC.  )


  4) Make histograms.

  gmake run_compare

  run_compare 
  OR
  run_compare doPrint(number) [doPrint(0): Do not save image files, useful for viewing fit results only]
  OR
  run_compare doPrint(number) logScale(number)  [logScale(1): Use log scale for specified plots]
 
      ex ) run_compare 1 1 (Save image files and use log scale)

  images/*.pdf  ... pdf files of each histogram
  images/*.png  ... png files of each histogram
